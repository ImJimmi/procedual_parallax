# Procedural Parallax

[View the site](https://imjimmi.github.io/procedural_parallax/)

This page uses an HTML5 canvas, simplex noise, and some crappy JavaScript code to render multiple layers that all scroll at different speeds to create the pseudo-3D effect.

The simplex noise is calculated using this GitHub repo:
